## libft

project of School 42 where it is necessary to implement
own library of functions from libraries ctype.h, stdlib.h, string.h in C.

the functions work just like the original functions from the standard library.

the project was made in accordance with the school design code standard in the C language.

### how to use
```
make
gcc main.c -L. libft.a
./a.out
```

| ft_tolower | makes to lower case letter conversion |
| ft_toupper | makes to upper case letter conversion |
| ft_calloc | allocates size of memory and returns a pointer |
| ft_substr | allocates and returns a substring from the string |
| ft_strjoin | allocates and returns a concatenated new string |
| ft_strtrim | removes given characters from the beginning and the end of the string |

| ft_itoa | returns a string representing the integer received as an argument | 
| ft_strmapi | applies the function 'f' to each character of the string |
| ft_putchar_fd | outputs the character to the given file descriptor
| ft_putstr_fd | outputs the string to the given file descriptor
| ft_putendl_fd | outputs the string to the given file descriptor, followed by a newline |
| ft_putnbr_fd | outputs the integer to the given file descriptor
| ft_lstnew | returns a new element. The variable 'content' is initialized with the value of the parameter 'content' |

| ft_lstsize | counts the number of elements in a list|
| ft_lstlast | returns the last element of list |
| ft_lstadd_back | add new element at end of the list |
| ft_lstdelone | takes as a parameter an element and frees the memory of the elementâ€™s content |
| ft_lstclear | deletes and frees the given element and every successor of that element |
| ft_lstiter | iterates the list and appllies the given function to the content of each element |
| ft_lstmap | iterates the list and appllies the function to the content of each element. creates a new list resulting of the successive applications of the function |
